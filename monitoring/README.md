# JustNews Unified Observability Platform Design

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the design for a comprehensive observability platform that will replace the current fragmented
monitoring setup with a unified, production-ready system supporting centralized logging, advanced metrics collection,
distributed tracing, and real-time monitoring dashboards.

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Capabilities

- **Basic Prometheus/Grafana Stack**: Systemd-based deployment patterns for Prometheus, AlertManager, Grafana, Node
  Exporter, DCGM Exporter. Kubernetes manifests and Docker Compose assets are deprecated and archived under
  `infrastructure/archives/`; use systemd artifacts under`infrastructure/systemd/` for active deployments.

- **Metrics Collection**: Basic Prometheus client integration in `common/metrics.py` with HTTP request metrics, system
  resources, and GPU monitoring

- **Alert Rules**: Comprehensive alerting rules for service health, performance, and business metrics

- **Dashboards**: Three basic Grafana dashboards (system overview, content pipeline, GPU monitoring)

- **Configuration**: Static IP-based service discovery in Prometheus configuration

- **✅ Centralized Logging**: **COMPLETED** - Full centralized logging system with structured logging, aggregation,
  storage, and analysis

### Identified Gaps

- **Distributed Tracing**: Empty `tracing.py` file with no tracing implementation

- **Service Mesh Integration**: No service discovery or mesh-level observability

- **Advanced Metrics**: Limited custom metrics and performance profiling capabilities

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Basic dashboards without advanced visualization or alerting

- **Compliance Monitoring**: No audit logging or regulatory compliance tracking

- **Performance Profiling**: No detailed performance analysis or bottleneck identification
